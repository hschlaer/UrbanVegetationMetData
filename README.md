# UrbanVegetationMetData
Temporally averaged meteorology data from the GVF50 and baseline simulations (WRF Chem v. 3.7 coupled to the single layer urban canopy model)
List of variables and their units: 2m air temperature (t2; K), surface temperature (tsk; K), green vegetation fraction, latent heat flux (lh; W/m2), sensible heat flux (sh; W/m2), relative humidity (rh), and the planetary boundary layer height (pblh; m)
