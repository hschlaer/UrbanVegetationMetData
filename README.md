# Urban Vegetation Met Data
Temporally averaged meteorology data from the GVF50 and baseline simulations (WRF Chem v. 3.7 coupled to the single layer urban canopy model)
List of variables and their units: 
2m air temperature (t2, K)
surface temperature (tsk, K)
green vegetation fraction (gvf, unitless)
latent heat flux (lh, W/m2)
sensible heat flux (sh, W/m2)
relative humidity (rh, %)
planetary boundary layer height (pblh, m)
